# Forum Eye

Forum Eye is a collection of scripts designed to monitor chatboxes and parse thread titles on online forums. The goal is to facilitate the monitoring of shoutboxes, parsing threads, and adding many other features in the future.

## Features

- **Chatbox Monitoring**: Keep track of messages in the chatbox for analysis or archival purposes.
- **Thread Title Parsing**: Extract and process thread titles for data mining or content analysis.
- **Extensible Design**: Built with future enhancements in mind, allowing for the addition of new features.

## Motivation

In a digital environment where chatbox monitoring is common, this project aims to provide an open-source solution for individuals who wish to conduct their own monitoring and analysis. By creating our own tool and making it open source, we encourage transparency and community collaboration.

## Disclaimer

Please use this tool responsibly and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Unauthorized monitoring or data collection may violate terms of service or legal statutes.
